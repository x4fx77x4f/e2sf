# E2SF
E2SF is an [Expression 2](https://github.com/wiremod/wire/wiki/Expression-2) to Lua transpiler, and a [StarfallEx](https://github.com/thegrb93/StarfallEx)-based runtime for running transpiled E2 code. It is currently extremely incomplete and not usable for anything.

## Usage
1. `cd ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/GarrysMod/garrysmod/data/starfall`
2. `git clone https://github.com/x4fx77x4f/e2sf.git`
3. Flash `e2sf/init.lua` to a Starfall Processor (after changing hardcoded path)
4. Place and wire a Starfall Component
